# song-scraper
This python web scraping script is use to download top 21 bollywood songs of Today/Yesterday/Week/Month/All from www.mymp3song.site. This repository/project is intended for Educational Purposes ONLY. It is not intended to be used for any purpose other than learning, so please do not use it for any other reason than to learn about scraping!!  Please do not open issues complaining that the code is "Not Working"...  MyMp3Songs have every right to change their UI as they see fit.  When they do change their UI the scraper will inevitably "break"!

# Libraries Required
1. bs4
  Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
  These instructions illustrate all major features of Beautiful Soup 4, with examples. I show you what the library is good for, how it works, how to use it, how to make it do what you want, and what to do when it violates your expectations.
  The examples in this documentation should work the same way in Python 2.7 and Python 3.2.
  You might be looking for the documentation for Beautiful Soup 3. If so, you should know that Beautiful Soup 3 is no longer being developed, and that Beautiful Soup 4 is recommended for all new projects. If you want to learn about the differences between Beautiful Soup 3 and Beautiful Soup 4, see Porting code to BS4.

2. requests
  Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor. Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3.

3. os
  This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open(), if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput module. For creating temporary files and directories see the tempfile module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.
